# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis using SQL

## Overview
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The primary objective is to derive valuable insights and answer business-related queries based on the dataset. The project involves exploring content distribution, ratings, release years, countries, and durations, along with other insights.

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on keywords.

## Dataset
The data for this analysis is sourced from Netflixâ€™s public dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download).

## Schema
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;

CREATE TABLE netflix
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(5),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),
    country      VARCHAR(550),
    date_added   VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
